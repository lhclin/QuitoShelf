Instructions
------------
You need to install OpenSCAD (openscad.org).

1.In OpenSCAD, you need to create: a shelf (create using Shelf.scad),
a plate (create using QuickRelease*Plate.scad) and
some optional accessories (create using Accessories.scad).

Shelves all have the same foot print. So they are stackable. The height is customizable. I
test mostly with 40mm(Slim) and 50mm(Standard). You can optionally connect the shelves
side-by-side using the Side Clip Accessories.

2. 3D Print the shelf, plate, accessories
3. Mount the equipment in the plate. You may need mounting screws (Accessories or M4).
4. Slide the plate into the shelf
5. (Optional) Secure the plate to the shelf using Plate Stoppers (Accessories or M3).

Makefile
